		<p>Pizza (English: /ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1]

		The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating modern pizza in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In 2009, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish. In 2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was added to UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[7]

		Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[8] In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[9][10] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. They are then cooked using a home oven.

		In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[11] Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged two years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[12]</p>

		<p>The term hamburger originally derives from Hamburg, the second-largest city in Germany; however, there is no certain connection between the food and the city.[4]

		By back-formation, the term "burger" eventually became a self-standing word that is associated with many different types of sandwiches, similar to a (ground meat) hamburger, but made of different meats such as buffalo in the buffalo burger, venison, kangaroo, chicken, turkey, elk, lamb or fish such as salmon in the salmon burger, but even with meatless sandwiches as is the case of the veggie burger.[5]

		The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term patty is rarely used or can even refer to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger. In many English-speaking countries outside the United States, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, a piece of chicken breast on a bun is known as a chicken burger, which would generally not be considered to be a burger in the United States; Americans would generally call it a chicken sandwich, but in Commonwealth English a sandwich typically requires sliced bread and anything with a bun is usually considered a burger</p>

		<p>Panipuri has evolved significantly over time. Originally known as "gol gappa," the dish consisted of a small, hollow, fried wheat shell filled with spiced mashed potatoes and served with a tamarind or mint-flavored water. Over time, variations of the filling and the flavored water emerged, reflecting the regional preferences and availability of ingredients. The flavored water, also known as the "pani," is an essential component of the dish and is often the main source of flavor. Some of the most popular flavors of panipuri include the traditional tamarind and mint water, as well as spicy variations like jalapeño or green chili water, and tangy flavors like lemon or tomato water.[8] Some regional variations also use sweet flavors like fruit juices or dates.[8]</p>
